ArnoldJS
-------------

Inspired by [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC), ArnoldJS is an Arnold Schwarzenegger based programming
language that transpiles into JavaScript.

Installation:

`npm install -g arnoldjs`

Usage:

`arnoldjs [input-file] [output-file]`

The contents of `[output-file]` will be replaced by the transpiled contents of `[input-file]`.
